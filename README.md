# RGB-Image-Histograms-Grayscale-OpenCV
RGB Image to Grayscale. Computing intensity histograms

1. Create a function to convert the RGB image to a grayscale image using the average method.
Display the output image along with the respective input image.
2. Create a function to compute the intensity histograms of all the images in part 1 (RGB and
grayscale). Plot the histograms of the RGB and grayscale images.
3. Write a program that calls the functions above and performs the histogram equalization on
the enclosed image (Image-1). Display the original and histogram-equalized images. Repeat
the experiment for different types of input images (extreme dark and extreme light).
